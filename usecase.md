Secure Endpoint MSSP Audit Automation
=====================================
## Automating common tasks to increase MSSP efficiency

Currently to verify currently deployed connector versions of Secure Endpoint is a manual process, or could require multiple API calls and scripting.  This is time consuming and complex for MSSP partners managing multiple Secure Endpoint customers.
To help MSSP partners scale resources and simplify operations this workflow was developed leveraging SecureX Orchestration.  This workflow can be adapted & modified to check various other policy & deployment configurations across multiple customers.
Additionally, this workflow could be configured to run on a schedule automatically if desired.
